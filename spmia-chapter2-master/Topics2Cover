1.	Spring Cloud – Day 1
	a.	Monolith vs Microservice – Different Modules / Aspects / Swimlane diagram
	b.	Cloud Intro and Deployment of MS
	c.	High level Intro – MS Components
	d.	MS Building Blocks – GCPICE
	e.	Resiliency Patterns 
	f.	CI/CD Patterns
	g.	Basic Demo
	h.	Cloud Configuration
		i.	@EnableConfigServer
		ii.	Need for cloud config
		iii.	Cloud Config server demo
		iv.	Hit profiles - /ls/default
		v.	Client config
		vi.	/actuator/env endpoint
		vii./refresh endpoint
2.	Spring Cloud – Day 2
	a.	Service Discovery
		i.	Load Balancers as Single points of failures. Horizontal and dynamic scaling 
		ii.	Highly Avail, Fault Tolerant, Load Balanced, Peer to Peer, Resilient
		iii.	@EnableEurekaserver annotation, waittimeinms uncomment otherwise need to wait for 5 mins for each app to be published
		iv.	Registering service with Eureka
	b.	Different Clients
		i.	@EnableDiscoveryClient annotation and explore OrganizationDiscoveryClient
		ii.	DiscoveryClient with RestTemplate - @LoadBalanced annotation in the Application class.  Servername in url = Application id . Refer OrganizationRestTempClient
		iii.	FeignClient @EnableFeignClients Annotation, 	Refer OrganizationFeignClient Interface. Methods in the interface with @Requestmapping to convey target services to hit
3.	Spring Cloud – Day 3
	a.	Resiliency
		i.	Resiliency Patterns  - ClientSide Load Balancing, Fallback, CircuitBreaker, Bulkhead
		ii.	@EnableCircuitBreaker, @HystrixCommand annotations
		iii.	CircuitBreaker – Fail Fast, Gracefully and recover Seamlessly. CommandProperty – Timeout
		iv.	CircuitBreaker timing and failure window calculation
		v.	Fallbackmethod
		vi.	Bulkhead Pattern – threadpoolproperty of @HystrixCommand : coreSize, maxSize, 
4.	Spring Cloud – Day 4
	a.	Service Routing
		1. Service Gateway - Reverse Proxy. Helps Dynamic Routing, Security and analytics
		2. Zuul - URL Mapper and Interceptor. @Enablezuulproxy annotation. Don't use @EnableZuulServer. It is for custom service routing
		3. Zuul > Ribbon > Eureka
		4. url mapping techniques - Automated from Service Discovery, Manual from Service Discovery, Manual from static url
		5. Explore the zuulservice.yml in the config server to see how the above mappings are done
		6. zuul setting ignored services to reject mapping services from eureka. Can be all(*) or selective
		7. zuul filters - Pre, Post and Route Filters 
	b.	EDA??
